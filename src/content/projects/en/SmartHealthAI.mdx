## About Smart Health AI

Smart Health AI is a robust full-stack ML-powered application that enables users to predict the risk of **eight major diseases** based on simple clinical inputs. Designed with a modular **FastAPI** backend and a snappy **React + TailwindCSS** frontend, the system goes a step further by enabling **user feedback loops** and **live retraining** of models—making it an end-to-end example of real-world MLOps.

Each disease has its own prediction pipeline built using **scikit-learn**, with **MLflow** tracking model metrics and versions. Users can submit new data post-prediction, and an endpoint is available for **on-demand retraining**, keeping the models continually updated.

- **Predicts 8 Diseases with ML Pipelines**  
  Supports risk prediction for Anemia, Cardiovascular Disease, Heart Disease, Hepatitis C, Liver Disease, Lung Cancer, Stroke, and Thyroid Disease.

- **Modular ML Pipelines Per Disease**  
  Each disease prediction is powered by its own standalone scikit-learn pipeline, allowing easy updates, experimentation, and isolated debugging—ensuring better maintainability and control.

- **MLflow-Powered MLOps**  
  Model training runs, metrics, and artifacts are versioned and logged with MLflow.

- **FastAPI Backend & Docker Deployment**  
  Built for production with FastAPI and Docker Compose for quick orchestration of backend + frontend.

- **Frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind**  
  Sleek, responsive UI lets users input clinical data and view real-time predictions.
