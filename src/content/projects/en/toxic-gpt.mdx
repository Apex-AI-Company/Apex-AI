## About ToxicGPT

ToxicGPT began as an exploration into bias and toxicity in language models, and evolved into a hands-on deep dive into alignment, lightweight fine-tuning, and ethical deployment. We fine-tuned GPT-2 on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment dataset using **QLoRA** and **PEFT** (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), achieving faster training with minimal compute.

Once trained, the model was deployed via a **Flask** backend with session tracking and exposed to a **React.js** frontend that allowed users to experiment with toxicity prompts. To push the boundaries of the project further, we integrated **Stable Diffusion** to generate **multimodal outputs** (image generation based on text prompts), adding a fascinating visual layer to toxic or aligned text.

- **Efficient Fine-Tuning with QLoRA**  
  Applied 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters to fine-tune GPT-2 on toxic text using minimal resources.

- **Flask API & Session Logging**  
  Built a fast, lightweight REST API with per-session tracking for input prompts, outputs, and feedback.

- **Interactive React Frontend**  
  Developed an intuitive interface with prompt input, generation preview.

- **MLflow for Experiment Tracking**  
  All hyperparameters, model versions, and metrics logged using MLflow for reproducibility and comparison.

- **DVC for Dataset & Model Versioning**  
  Managed large model checkpoints and the Jigsaw dataset efficiently with DVC for clean collaboration and history.
