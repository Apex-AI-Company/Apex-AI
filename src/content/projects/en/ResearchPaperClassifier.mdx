## About Publication Classifier

Publication Classifier is a hybrid NLP system that analyzes research papers to determine their **publishability** and recommend the most suitable **conference**. It combines modern transformer models like **SciBERT** and **Sentence-BERT** with classic machine learning and self-training strategies to generate interpretable, high-quality predictions.

The classifier uses **text embeddings** from SciBERT to evaluate whether a paper should be published. If deemed publishable, a semantic similarity approach using Sentence-BERT matches the paper with top-tier conferences such as **CVPR**, **NeurIPS**, **EMNLP**, **KDD**, and **TMLR**.

- **SciBERT for Content Understanding**  
  Generates deep contextual embeddings from full paper content for classification tasks.

- **Self-Training Publishability Classifier**  
  Uses a small set of labeled papers to iteratively train on larger unlabeled datasets with pseudo-labels.

- **Sentence-BERT for Conference Matching**  
  Identifies the most semantically relevant conference based on similarity with topic prototypes.

- **Plug-and-Play with CSV Input**  
  Accepts labeled and unlabeled CSVs, and outputs results to `results/output.csv`â€”ready for evaluation or submission.

- **Expandable & Modular Codebase**  
  Easy to fine-tune, extend with new conferences, or upgrade with better models like Longformer or GPT.
